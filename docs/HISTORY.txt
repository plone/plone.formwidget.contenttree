Changelog
=========

1.0b3 (2011-02-11)
------------------

* Use `zope.i18n.translate` instead of translation_service, since
  translation_service was removed in plone4.
  [jbaumann]


1.0b2 (2010-08-25)
------------------

* Fall back to the site to perform content-related operations if the
  context is not wrapped into an aquisition chain.
  [dukebody]

* Compute the view name as the request URL left-stripped the content
  absolute URL.
  [dukebody]

* Make it possible to restrict the field to objects below a path
  The constructor of ObjPathSource takes a path keyword argument
  with a PathIndex catalog query. This argument filters objects
  outside of this path. If the navigation_tree_query does not have
  a path argument, the path is also copied into this query.
  [gaudenzius]

* Update widget in the contenttree-fetch browser view
  The widget.update() call rebinds to source which previously
  was only bound during traversal. This avoids problems with
  sources that only work after security is applied.
  [gaudenzius]

  german translations.
