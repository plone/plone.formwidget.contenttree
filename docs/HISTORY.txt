Changelog
=========

1.0.5 (2012-02-20)
------------------

* Added Spanish translation
  [hvelarde]

1.0.4 (2011-10-04)
------------------

* fix _getBrainByValue to check if value is traversable
  first so we can provide the correct token.
  [vangheem]

1.0.3 (2011-09-24)
------------------

* Add zh_CN translation.
  [jianaijun]

1.0.2 (2011-07-02)
------------------

* Fix regression that broke the browsing with JQuery < 1.4.
  [davisagli]

1.0.1 (2011-05-16)
------------------

* Make placeholder terms for hidden / missing items, so that you can still see
  something in the editing interface and not accidentally remove them. Ideally
  we should say if a page is invisible or missing, but not today.
  [lentinj]

* Use javascript function from plone.formwidget.autocomplete to add new input
  boxes, make javascript as clone-safe (when making new rows in datagridfield)
  as possible
  [lentinj]

* Just use full widget name in ++widget++ URL, don't try and strip form prefix
  off. If within a subform, this is the wrong thing to do and the traverser now
  supports stripping the initial 'form.widgets'
  [lentinj]

* Workaround for sources being used without being bound first.
  [lentinj]

* Check the request for context before falling back to getSite()
  [lentinj]

* Add a UUIDSource that stores plone.uuid pointers to content.
  [lentinj]

* Use tokens as full URL of content, move all token<->value operations into the
  source. Rename methods so that actually-public methods have public names
  [lentinj]

* Alter terms so that token is the full path to an item, value is the path
  without portal_url that is stored in the DB. This means all the path parsing
  can be kept within the source.
  [lentinj]

* _filter is used outside the source, so not an internal helper function
  anymore.
  [lentinj]

1.0 (2011-04-30)
----------------

* Made compatible with Plone 4.1 by loading the permissions.zcml from
  Products.CMFCore (only when plone.app.upgrade is available, to keep
  compatibility with Plone 3, if we currently have that).
  [maurits]

* Improved CSS for selected items to make them more evident in the Sunburst
  theme.
  [davisagli]

* Add content type CSS class to items in the navtree so that icons are shown
  in Plone 4.
  [davisagli]

1.0b3 (2011-02-11)
------------------

* Use `zope.i18n.translate` instead of translation_service, since
  translation_service was removed in plone4.
  [jbaumann]


1.0b2 (2010-08-25)
------------------

* Fall back to the site to perform content-related operations if the
  context is not wrapped into an acquisition chain.
  [dukebody]

* Compute the view name as the request URL left-stripped the content
  absolute URL.
  [dukebody]

* Make it possible to restrict the field to objects below a path
  The constructor of ObjPathSource takes a path keyword argument
  with a PathIndex catalog query. This argument filters objects
  outside of this path. If the navigation_tree_query does not have
  a path argument, the path is also copied into this query.
  [gaudenzius]

* Update widget in the contenttree-fetch browser view
  The widget.update() call rebinds to source which previously
  was only bound during traversal. This avoids problems with
  sources that only work after security is applied.
  [gaudenzius]


1.0b1 - 2010-04-19
------------------

* Adjusted styles so the widget looks reasonable with Plone 4's sunburst theme.
  [davisagli]

* Fix icons in CMF 2.2.  This closes
  http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=111
  [davisagli]

* Make the widget work properly on Zope 2.12
  [optilude]

* Add a template for HIDDEN_MODE.
  [csenger]

* Convert all strings in a new navtree node into unicode using the site
  encoding to render non-ascii characters in the widget.
  [csenger]

* Added message IDs for translations and added locales directory with
  german translations.
  [jbaumann]

1.0a5 - 2009-08-02
------------------

* Don't filter children of non-queriable parent types (e.g. Large Plone
  Folders).
  [optilude]

1.0a3 - 2009-07-12
------------------

* Apply patch from Gerhard Weis to make the lightbox play nicer with CSS
  z-indexes.
  [optilude]

1.0a3 - 2009-06-29
------------------

  namespace traversal (++add++...)
  [optilude]

1.0a2 - 2009-06-28
------------------

* Fix display widgets.
  [optilude]

* Import SitemapNavtreeStrategy conditionally so it doesn't break on Plone
  trunk. [davisagli]
